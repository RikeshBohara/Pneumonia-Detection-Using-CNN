The look employs a bendy and efficient technique of deep learning of applying the model of CNN in predicting and detecting a patient unaffected and affected with the sickness using a chest X-ray photograph.  The project is about diagnosing pneumonia from X-Ray images of lungs of a person using self-laid convolutional neural network. The images were of size greater than 1000 pixels per dimension and the total dataset was tagged large and had a space of 2GB. Also, the images in the dataset were uneven where data for pneumonic lungs were higher than that of Healthy lungs. </p>
